### Personal Characteristics:
*Sirona is probably the bulkiest person we've come across on our travel that hasn't trried to catch or kill us. Despite the fearsome looking scar and sort of gloomy aura to her, she's about the the most pleasant person we've come across so far over the year. That being said, she's also very... insistent and wouldn't let me leave the room until after a bunch of "check-ups" she called them. Anin seems fine enough with her (through the several arguments); though, he says there's something else with her, like a deep sadness. - Log #*

Sirona is a human who towers at about 6' 9". Adding to her height, she also sports a built form, dark brown hair, and a ghastly facial scar which gives her a formidable presence in comparison to Wander. Despite this, her eyes are nice emerald green, which become emphasized during her lighter moments. 
In contrast to her frequent gloomy aura, she has an optimistic side to her that srives to help people, though she can also be very dogged in her approaches. 

During a fight, she revealed that she had the ability to sprout radient angelic wings capable of flight for a period of time. Sirona originally believed that this was one of her paladin abilities. However, she would later find out from  [[Jericho]] and [[Moenbryda]] that it is her innate ability as an aasimar, a celestial being made mortal.


### Bio:
Sirona spent her earlier years in Ashgore as part of the Elffire estate, one of the noble families that dedicated themselves as healers to the people. When not in the major city, they traveled the continent to lend aid during illnesses and pandemics. Sirona has said her family took pride in their work and duty to those around them, describing them fondly as "hippy-dippy".

In the wake of [[the Boom]] and the onset of war, her world began to descend. The peaceful atmosphere changed to grim tidings and bitter bloodthirst. Jericho, her older cousin, was drafted into the war without her knowing and absconded from her. Afterwards, Tallulah, her other cousin, made journey for [[Ioto]], but never returned or was heard from since. While neighbors, peers, and the people of Ashgore encouraged the war, her family, especially her parents, stood rooted on their stance against the war, even actively discouraging it. Their opposition, formational to Sirona, would ultimately cost them their lives, as the people of Ashgore and unknown conspirators amognst the nobles massacred the Elffires and left the estate scorched. Sirona, assumed dead, was not pursued and escaped into hiding.
