### Personal Characteristics:
*Sirona is probably the bulkiest person we've come across on our travel that hasn't trried to catch or kill us. Despite the fearsome looking scar and sort of gloomy aura to her, she's about the the most pleasant person we've come across so far over the year. That being said, she's also very... insistent and wouldn't let me leave the room until after a bunch of "check-ups" she called them. Anin seems fine enough with her (through the several arguments); though, he says there's something else with her, like a deep sadness.*

Sirona is a human who towers at about 6' 9". Adding to her height, she also sports a built form, dark brown hair, and a ghastly facial scar which gives her a formidable presence in comparison to Wander. Despite this, her eyes are nice emerald green, which become emphasized during her lighter moments. 
In contrast to her frequent gloomy aura, she has an optimistic side to her that srives to help people, though she can also be very dogged in her approaches. 

During a fight, she revealed that she had the ability to sprout radient angelic wings capable of flight for a period of time. Sirona originally believed that this was one of her paladin abilities. However, she would later find out from  [[Jericho]] and [[Moenbryda]] that it is her innate ability as an aasimar, a celestial being made mortal.
