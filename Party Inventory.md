### Uncomon - 
- __Armed Bag__
Possesion: Trognak

 *"A bag made out of the dehydrated head of a monstrous elk with human arms instead of antlers. After the head was removed, the latent magic in the creature remained, creating what seems to be an extra dimensional space inside the head."*

  This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 3 feet in diameter at the mouth and 3 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 250 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 27 cubic feet. The bag weighs 20 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action, as you stuff your arm into the Elk’s mouth and pull the item out from its extra-dimensional maw. The arms have linked up and formed into handles that work to either hold the head as a bag or a backpack, and the items inside the severed head will not fall out unless shaken out purposefully by the owner.

  Placing the Armed Bag inside an extra-dimensional space created by a Handy Haversack, Portable Hole, Bag of Holding, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

 *Curse.* This item is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a remove curse spell or similar magic. As long as you remain cursed, you cannot discard the stone, which immediately teleports back into your pocket or pack. After you use the stone's magic, your next two ability checks are made with disadvantage. 

  *THIS ITEM HAS BEEN TAKEN BY AN UNKNOWN CURSE*

- ~~__Gem of the Drunkard, A__~~
Possession: Gilly
Converted into residium

 *" This gem smells of old, ale-stained wood, and when pressed against your ear, you can hear old melodic hums that stir happy thoughts within your heart."*
 
  While wearing it, you can regain 4d4 + 4 hit points when you drink a pint of beer, ale, mead, or wine. Once the amulet has restored hit points, it can't do so again until the next dawn.*

---

- __Pitcher Plant__
Possession: Gilly

 *" This pitcher, made out of living wood from the living dome, has trapped the corrupted ichor that bled from the vine golem and repurposed its corruption into a more helpful artifact. In Druidic, the phrase "Drink my friends, and press onward" is etched into the constantly shifting surface."*
 
  The pitcher is able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the pitcher when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty.

  You can use an action and name one liquid from the table below to cause the pitcher to produce the chosen liquid, as the shifting vines writhe more quickly and produce the liquid out of seemingly nowhere . Afterward, you can tip the pitcher as an action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the pitcher can produce depends on the liquid you named. Once the pitcher starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.

  |Liquid Max | Amount|
 |---|---|
 |Acid | 8 ounces|
 |Basic poison | 1/2 ounce|
 |Beer | 4 gallons|
 |Honey | 1 gallon|

- __Ring of Memories, A__
Possession: Sirona

---

- ~~__Feywild Shard, A__~~
Possession: Wander

 *" This warm crystal glints with the sunset colors of the Feywild sky and evokes whispers of emotional memory."*
 
  As an action, you can attach the shard to a powerful magical source.*

  When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in the Player's Handbook. If the result is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.

  If you don't have the Wild Magic Sorcerous Origin, once this property is used to roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

---

- __Wisp Cloak, A__
Possession: Wander

 *" This near-weightless cloak billows softly even without wind."*
 
  While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on death saving throws and can move normally through the space of any Medium or smaller creature once on each of your turns, but can't stop there.*

---

- __Harvest, A__
Possession: [[Sirona Elffire]]

 *" This classic farmer's heirloom depicts wheat and field designs."* 
 
  You add +1 to attack and damage rolls done with this weapon. When you hit a plant creature with an attack using this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 slashing damage. In addition, any nonmagical plant harvested with this sickle remains fresh for an extra 7 days.*

---

- __Ambitious Medic's Box, A__
Possession: Ham

  This wooden box has two halves which are magically locked by ornamental clasps that can only be opened during certain times of the day. The box is 1 foot wide, 2 feet long, and weighs 3 pounds. You can open and use the box as normal, as described below, even if you aren't attuned to it. 

  The left side is locked by a metal clasp decorated with a sun. From dawn until dusk, you can open the left side of the box, which contains the same contents and functions identically to a healer's kit. Each day at dusk, the left side of the box magically closes and regains all expended uses of its healer's kit.

  The right side is locked by a metal clasp decorated with a moon smoking a pipe. From dusk until dawn, you can open the right side of the box, which contains three pewter steins, a flask, and a wooden pipe. While holding the flask, you can use an action to speak its command word followed by either "beer", "wine", or "whiskey". When you do, the flask magically fills with up to 4 gallons of beer, 1 gallon of wine, or 8 ounces of liquor, depending on the chosen drink, which can be poured out as an action, up to 1 gallon per minute. Once this property of the flask has been used, it can't be used again until the next dusk. The wooden pipe is magically refilled with tobacco daily at dusk. Each day at dawn, the right side of the box magically closes, and anything removed from the box is magically returned to it.

  While attuned to the box, you are proficient in the Medicine skill and can open either side of the box at any time. If you're already proficient in the Medicine skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses that skill.

>*"He hated the adventuring: the uncertainty of life and death, the lost comforts of home, and the walking. It was a far cry from his comfortable life back in Breezeport. Gods, how he missed having a bed.*
>
>*But he knew that it was his job to worry as a healer and caretaker. His concern allowed those braver than he to charge headlong into battle: a kindness and responsibility they'd remind him of often during his evening smokes. It was a kind of comradery that was new to him.* 
>
>*So it was with a caring and poetic irony that he left his box and equipment to the group before they parted ways. Though he had returned home, he hoped that the box would serve as a constant reminder to them that even though he may no longer be with them, it would still fall to him to help his new friends come back home alive."*

- __Rosebud, A__
Possession: ~~Leo~~, Blevins
Formerly: Club of Stained Shifting

 *" This wooden club's head has been naturally formed into the shape of a dragon's maw.""*

  As an action, you can speak the club's command word (Rose) and strike the ground with it to cause the club to momentarilly shift to stained glass and cause a wave of jagged glass shards and rose thorns to spring up from the ground in a 15-foot cone in front of you. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 slashing damage and be grappled by the rose thorns for up to 1 minute. A grappled creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check, freeing itself on a success. At the end of each of its turns, a grappled creature takes 1d6 piercing damage as it's constricted by the thorny vines and stabbed by glass. Once this property of the club has been used, it can't be used again until the next long rest.
 
  *" Once wielded by the last guardian of The Sunken Temple, this club has been transformed due to the clashing of nature and arcane. This wooden club's head has been naturally formed into the shape of a dragon's maw, which now is filled with red rose petals. Cracks are strewn along the handle, thrumming with energy and wisps of shade."*
  
   This weapon provides +2 to attack and damage rolls. While attuned, gain resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against poisons. As a bonus action by speaking the command word (Rosebud), you can shift the weapon from a club into a spear or a great whip (3d4, reach, two-handed, finesse). If you are attuned to Rosebud, you have proficiency in spears and great whips.

- __Forgekeeper's Spark__
Possession: Wander

  "* A lingering fragment of a fire spirit remains attached to this piece of coal, keeping it covered in harmless blue embers that are pleasantly warm to the touch. When surrounded by fire, the coal burns with a magical blue flame and the spirit within it emerges. The spirit remains until the fire goes out or is doused, at which point the spirit hides within its coal until immersed in flames once more. If removed from the fire, the spirit moves with the burning coal and remains for up to 1 minute."*

  While the spirit is present, it helps tend to the fire it's placed in. The spirit can maintain a fire that fills up to a 5-foot cube. A fire tended to by the spirit gains the following benefits:* 
  1. It can't be extinguished by strong winds.
  2. It produces no smoke, unless you want it to.
  3. It burns for twice the normal duration with the same amount of fuel. - Any food being cooked in the fire is kept at an ideal temperature. 
  4. In addition, you have advantage on any ability check you make that uses either cook's utensils or glassblower's, smith's, or tinker's tools to heat and craft items in the fire. If you roll a 15 or higher on the d20, the time it takes to use the tools in this way is halved. 

   *Sentience.* The forgekeeper's spark is a sentient lawful neutral item with an Intelligence of 1, a Wisdom of 6, and a Charisma of 1. It is immune to fire damage and has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. It can't speak or read, but understands Common and Ignan.* 

   *Personality.* Though it was once an angry fire elemental and keeps its hot temper, the forgekeeper's spark is happiest in the fires of a forge, but also enjoys maintaining campfires. It is strict with the boundaries of its fire, preventing it from spreading uncontrollably, and is resourceful with how it manages any fuel that it's given. It enjoys assisting with tasks, such as cooking and metalworking, and snaps and pops with excited sparks when given something new to heat up.*

- __Stuffy__
Possession: Leo

 *" This small stuffed animal is soft to the touch and perfect for hugging."*
 
  If you can cast the _find familiar spell_, you can use the animal as the material component for the spell, without it being consumed. When you do, the familiar inhabits the form of the stuffed animal, whose appearance you can change as part of casting the spell in this way. The familiar is a construct, in addition to being either a celestial, fey, or fiend, but its statistics are otherwise unchanged from its normal form. The familiar's stuffed animal form must be appropriate to the statistics of its normal animal one. For example, a familiar within a griffon stuffed animal could use the statistics for a cat or hawk, but not a poisonous snake. The stuffed animal grows or shrinks to match the size of the familiar's normal form.* 

  While the familiar remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal stuffed animal. If you temporarily dismiss the familiar, the stuffed animal and familiar disappear into a pocket dimension together. If the familiar is dismissed forever or drops to 0 hit points, it leaves Stuffy behind. 

  When taking a long rest, Stuffy will do their best to protect you while you sleep, cuddling by your face and guarding your stomach. Every morning, small tears can be found on the floor at Stuffy's feet as they stare up at the sky.

- __Titan Cricket Greaves, A__
Possession: Lilith

 *" These unusual leg braces are crafted from the legs of a giant cricket."*
 
  While wearing the braces, your long jump is up to 25 feet and your high jump is up to 15 feet, unless it's already higher, with or without a running start. Further, your walking speed increases by 5 feet.* 

  In addition, you can use an action to rub your legs together while wearing the braces to create the signature sound of one or many crickets. The sound can be as quiet as a whisper or as loud as a scream.

---

- __Bramble Buckler, A__
Possession: Sirona

 *" This twisting mass of tightly knotted thorns forms a functional buckler. Its thorny limbs move ever so slightly to defend against incoming attacks that might otherwise pierce it."*
 
   When you don the shield, the vines grow harmlessly around the arm and hand that's holding it, preventing it from being unwillingly dropped or disarmed.

   As an action, you can speak the shield's command word and touch it to the ground at a point at your feet. When you do, you doff the shield as the vines release from your arm and rapidly grow across the ground, creating a visible line of thorns and brambles 20 feet long and 15 feet wide. The thorns recreate the effects of the_ spike growth spell_ within that area, without requiring concentration, and last for the spell's duration. When it ends, the thorns coalesce back into the twisted shield. You can speak the shield's command word again as an action while you're within 5 feet of the thorny area to end the effect early, causing the vines to regrow onto your arm as you don the shield again. Once this property of the shield has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Rare - 
- __Rings of the True Companions, A__
Possession: Sirona, Gilly

  These rings typically come in pairs but have been known to come in sets of up to four. Each ring is magically connected and can be attuned to by a different creature. While wearing one of the rings, you can use the following property even if you aren't attuned to it:

  1. When another creature that you can see who is also wearing one of the rings drops to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to cause that creature to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once this property of the rings has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. 
  2. If you find an additional ring of the true companions, you can add it to an existing set by holding all of the rings together for 1 minute. A ring can only be a part of one set at a time, and is removed from a set if it's more than 1 mile away from the other rings for 24 consecutive hours. 
  3. If you are the only creature attuned to one of the rings, it gains 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action expend 1 of its charges to cast the _cure wounds spell_ (spellcasting modifier +3). If the target of the spell is another creature wearing one of the rings, the spell's range increases to 30 feet. 
  4. If additional creatures are attuned to rings from the set, the rings' collective strength grows and they share a pool of charges instead. For each attuned creature after the first, the rings gain an extra 2 charges and regain another 2 expended charges daily at dawn. The rings can share a maximum of 9 charges in this way (1d3 + 6).

---

- __Contingency Band__
Possession: Ham

  *" Each of this leather ring's three braided bands bears the design of a dark, winding serpent."*
  
  You can use an action to submerge the ring in a potion of healing or similar healing draft. If the ring is left to sit in a potion for 1 minute in this way, the ring magically consumes it and any of its healing properties. For each potion the ring has consumed, one of its dark serpents glows with a faint red light. The ring can have up to 3 consumed potions at a time. *

   Immediately after you take damage while wearing the ring, you can use your reaction to speak its command word (pierce) and gain the healing effects of one of the ring's consumed potions (your choice). The consumed potion is then lost, and one of the ring's serpents becomes dark once more.

---

- __Urnblade, A__
Possession: Gilly

  *" This item appears to be a small cremation urn of a fallen guardian."* 
  
  While grasping the urn, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word (Despal) and cause its lid to unseal. When you do, a curved blade or axe of dark smoke pours from the mouth of the urn. Speaking the command word again reseals the urn and causes the weapon to disappear. *

   You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals necrotic damage instead of slashing damage.

---

- __Ironleaf Maul of Entaglement, A__
Possession: Trognak

   *" Despite the head of this maul being made from vines, it seems impossibly solid and carries with it a formidable heft."* 
   
   You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The maul has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges each day at dawn. When you hit a creature with the maul, you can expend a charge to force it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes 2d8 radiant damage as it is consumed by multicolored flowers. The DC for this property is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.

---

- __Webbed Ward, A__
Possession: Wander, Ham

  *" This pulsating mass of web awaits incoming creatures."*
  
  When hit by a melee weapon attack, the attackers speed is reduced by 10 feet. In addition, you can cast _shield_ and _mage armor_ once per day

---

### Very Rare -
- __Marvelous Pigments__
Possession: Gilly

  *" These pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image."* 

   Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 250 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate Objects or terrain features—such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons— that are up to 2,500 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet. 

   When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of Objects you create. 

   Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a Diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material. 

   If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.

---

### Legendary - 
- __Prismatic Lenses, A__
Possession: Anyone

  *" The lenses of these spectacles magically shift from color to color."* 

  As a bonus action while wearing these spectacles, you can change the active lenses to red, green, yellow, purple, blue, or pink. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or psychic damage, the damage type is changed to one of the following types based on the active lens color: *red: fire*, *green: acid*, *yellow: lightning*, *purple: poison*, *blue: cold*, *pink: psychic*.
  Alternatively, you may change the color of the lenses as if using the eye altering appearance of _Thaumaturgy_ for an indefinite amount of time, though this provides no mechanical benefits.

  Additionally, you gain a passive trait depending on the active lens as well: 
 1. *Red.* Each time you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you can deal 1d12 extra fire damage to one of the targeted creatures.
2. *Green.* Each time you cast a spell that deals acid damage, you can impose a -2 penalty to the AC of one of the targeted creatures. This penalty does not stack with itself and it lasts until the creature takes a long rest. 
3. *Yellow.* Your movement speed increases by 15 feet and your jumping distance is doubled. Purple. You have advantage on Constitution saving throws.
4. *Blue.* Ice collates around you; your AC increases by 2. 
5. *Pink.* As an action you can touch a willing creature to inhabit its mental space. While occupying their mind, your body disappears and you cannot be targeted by attacks or spells. Creatures with telepathy, or the ability to detect thoughts may know of your presence. If the creature whose mind you occupy takes psychic damage, you take it as well. The host creature has advantage on saving throws to resist being charmed while you are occupying their mind. You can communicate telepathically with the host creature, and you perceive the world using their senses. The only action you can take while in this state is to end the effect and reconstitute yourself in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature. If you are knocked unconscious or the host dies, the effect ends and you reconstitute in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature.

### Artifact - 
- __Fairy Cage, A by Lilith__
Possession: Lilith
  
  Inside a delicate looking silver cage lies a fairy. It is unable to communicate and is seemingly unintelligent, but can be fed any sweet food to shine brilliantly with 20 ft of bright light and an additional 20 ft of dim light. The light’s color depends on the fairy’s mood and what food it was given. The cage seems to sway unnaturally in certain directions, the reason for this is still unknown. The magic surrounding the cage seems to be intentionally inhibited and perhaps can be awakened to greater powers by some unknown means.
  
  *" The Fairy has been reunited with their love, and in doing so unlocked the hidden magical potential of this artifact."*

  It gains the following traits, which require attunement to use. 
  *Mother's Love* - All wildshape forms are bolstered by memories of one dear to you. All attacks are +2 to hit, and +2 to damage. 
  *Father's Protection* - Using his devilish powers, Samael's fairy infuses your wildshapes with Fiendish protection, adding +2 to their AC, halving all fire damage, and giving all wildshapes a slightly demonic look. 
  *Devil's Bargain* - In exchange for power, something else must be sacrificed. When attuned to, all spell slots of 3rd level or above are siphoned into the cage to empower the fairies. You can not regain these slots until you unattune from the magic item and take a long rest.*

---

- __Jade Serpent Staff__
Possession: Trognak, within his arm bag

  This staff is broken into five pieces, each worth 100 gp for the jade alone. The entire staff can be restored with mending cantrips; each casting of the spell repairs one break in the staff. 
  If the staff is made whole, it transforms from an object into an animated jade serpent that has the statistics of a giant poisonous snake, with these changes: 
  
  1. The serpent is a construct that understands and obeys whoever was holding the staff when it transformed.
  2. It has immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. It doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. 
  3. When it drops to 0 hit points, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, the snake turns to dust and is destroyed. On any other roll, it changes back into a staff and breaks into 1d4 + 1 pieces that must be magically mended before the staff can be used again.
