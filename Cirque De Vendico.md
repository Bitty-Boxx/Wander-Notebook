### Origins
Formed in: Fluke

Originally having little to no connection, the group became tasked with exploring and pillaging the [[Structures]] in order to ward off the interests of warring nations [[Ashgore]] and [[Fillthar]]. Doing so, the group discovered cryptic relics and buried secrets of the ancient past and became further entangled with immemorial powers, ranging from mystic to eldritch. 

After the events of the Battle for Fluke, the group gained firsthand knowledge that their primary spectator and instigator of events is the Grand Magus himself, a god by the name of [[Oris]]. 
Alongside two other gods, [[Red]] and [[Moenbryda]], the group journeys to gain power to defeat Oris, and possibly even end the war.

### Affiliations
