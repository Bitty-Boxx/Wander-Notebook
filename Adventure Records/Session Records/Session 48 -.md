: The party starts investigating while Gilly and her family grieve
	: Lilith looks, 
	: Leo finds that the goliaths threw their weapons at the place of their attacker from a range
		: The attacker was able to pick them off one by onefrom a distance, the goliaths were simply waiting to die fighting
	: Sirona aids and finds some who were killed without any notice, as well as an outcrop where they could have perched from
		: In the crag, they both find a patch of small grass that has been trampled and a goliath-made dagger buried into the rock wall
		: They find a bullet 
	: Wander investigates the bodies
		: They are like bags of skin now, even the injured ones now
		: 1 killed themself, 2 were stabbed from behind, the 2 daggers still on their belts
		: The rain stops them and the stick from finding anything useful
	: Back at the village, Leo and Wander investigate and scavenge the mabeast

: MB tells Lilith of Enka
	: Enka is a being, a King, and the being of Summer within the Feywild
	: He also is the Nowhere King
	: He can only be accessed through opening of a door by those who share his blood, the mabeast, and maybe some others
	: To keep the door from being opened by those who shouldn't, he transitions with each season of the material
		: He is Enka in the summer, he is the Nowhere King in the Fall, the Nightmare King in the winter, and the Nothing King in the Spring
	: For some reason, the transition has been inhibited or even halted
	
: Wander takes a look at the fabric Leo found and finds that it is fine silk with purple dye
	: Silk alone is a highly luxury item and physical purple dye is an expensive product to make/have
	: Silk could likely be from Ioto
	: The slag bullet that Sirona found is similar to a renissance hollow point; easy to manufacture but still

: Lilith goes to help care for the hospice
	: She meets with the dragonchess elder and finds him tightly gripping a piece
	: Lilith tries to retrieve it from his grasp, but the head of it pops off and reveals a note inside
	: On the note is a seires of numbers, another cipher
	: The elder goes back to his blank staring

: Leo looks at the cipher and finds out that it is called the King cipher
	: Enginging in a game of chess with the elder, he finds that the cipher is encoded through the Bacon cipher
	
: At the manor, the party, Robinfell, and Tal investigate the info acquired from Aion
	: Inside the bottom cask is a lockbox and a note
	: "I know not when you'll recieve this, but if you are reading, I have passed. It isn't much, but you deserve to have."
	: Robinfell opens the lockbox and finds a silver necklace and a pouch
	: The necklace was something from his late wife, the pouch though is filled with diamonds
: Asking more questions while walking, the party arrives nowhere on how the elder could have gotten that cipher or message
: Wander also asks about 

: Going back to Houston with the diamonds through the tree, Lilith feels a deep pain
	: She feels her heart shift and hears a booming voice from within
	: " Look within what has changed, look within. You are the only one who can do it. Change his fate."
	: Sirona assists Lilith and recieves a similar feeling
	: This feeling leads her thinking of the chess elder and "healing him"
